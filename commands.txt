Where are package configuration files stored:
(stored automatically during setup)
/usr/local/lib


Locate file:
locate file_name_substring
notice you need no wild cards, no inverted commas to locate file
containing substring.
to locate file with exactly file_name as filename:
locate 'file_name'
to locate file ending with file_name_end:
locate '*file_name_end'
to locate file starting with file_name_neg:
locate 'file_name_beg*'
 

Locate file with find:
find -name "text"
to separate stdout from stderr (stdout to file):
find -name "text" > temp.txt


Locate text within files:
to look in whole filesystem:
grep "text" /*
to look in a specific directory:
grep "text" /path/to/directory/*
to look in a specific directory and all its subdirectories:
grep "text" -r /path/to/directory/
notice no wildcard is needed in this case


Force copy recursively:
cp -rf target destination_directory
if this doesn't work, then your cp is aliased
move to another environment (bash, ksh, tcsh) and try again
hopefully cp won't be aliased everywhere


Extract archives:
to unpack tar.gz aka .tgz:
tar zxvf archive_name.tgz
to unpack tar.gz and place files in another folder:
tar zxvf archive_name.tgz -C /path/to/directory

Unzip:
unzip file.zip -d destination_folder
